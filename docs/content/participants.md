<i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i> The registration is **open until July 1st**.

* Please use the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeI6RYesaN5AOxwoazz4GvwZf1E_CbY8MaZQy2LyLy3HOk4SQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). We estimate that it will take 15-30 minutes to complete. We aim to select a group of about 40 participants with a range of expertise and interests, and with a balanced distribution across geographical location and career stage, while also aiming to include underrepresented groups.

<i class="fa-solid fa-envelope-open-text"></i> We will send notifications to the participants on July 15.

<i class="fa-solid fa-file-shield"></i> Any data you provide will be processed in accordance with the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy [privacy policy](http://www.mpia.de/privacy-policy).

_We will later list here the participants of the workshop, and we will add a group picture._
