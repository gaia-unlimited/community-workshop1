The workshop will start at 09:00 on Tuesday Sept. 13 and finish at 16:00 on Thursday Sept. 15

There will be a dedicated bus to bring participants from the town to the workshop venue (see details under travel below). Participants are responsible for organizing their travel to Heidelberg, and should make their own accommodation arrangements (see below). The conference fee covers coffee breaks and lunches, which will be provided on site.

If you need help with child care arrangements, please contact us.

Lunch and coffee breaks will be provided at the workshop venue on all days of the workshop. Vegetarian options will be available (no need to pre-order). If you have any additional dietary requirements, please email Carola Jordan well in advance.

To foster and thrive interactions between participants, we will be providing a reception buffet dinner on Wednesday evening at the venue.
_The bus schedule will be adapted._
